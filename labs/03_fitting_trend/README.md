# Laboratory 03: Fitting Trend to Data

Retrieve data on Gross Value Added for Poland from [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) including quarterly data for gross value added prices.

Next, estimate the parameters of three econometric models:

- linear regression,
- power regression,
- exponential regression.

For each model, draw a plot showing the fit of the estimated function to the empirical data. Compute the standard errors of the estimated parameters for all three models. Perform the t-Student test to evaluate the statistical significance of the parameters. Compare your results with those obtained using the built-in Excel module: `Data -> Data Analysis -> Regression`. Based on the obtained measures of fit and the statistical correctness of the estimates, select the model that best describes the analyzed data and justify your choice.
